# ring-correlation-id

A Ring-compatible Clojure library for correlation id middleware, to aid in tracing activity in a distributed system.

## Usage

```clojure
(use '[ring.middleware.correlation-id :as r-id])

;; For Ring: ensures a :correlation-id header, and binds ring.middleware.correlation-id/*correlation-id*
;; Sets Timbre *context* to {:correlation-id *correlation-id*}, so that the correlation id is natively
;; accessible to appenders
(def app
  (-> handler
      r-id/wrap-correlation-id))

(defn my-handler [request]
  {:status 200
   :body (format "Your correlation ID: %s" r-id/*correlation-id*)})

;; For clj-http, provides an additional-middleware function the creates or conveys the current
;; correlation id:

(use '[clj-http.client :as http])
(use '[clj-http.middleware.correlation-id :as c-id])

(http/with-additional-middleware
  [#'c-id/wrap-correlation-id]
  (http/get ...))

;; For Timbre, provides middleware that adds :correlation-id to the data map, so it's available
;; to all appenders.
;; This is most useful, for instance, with a custom appender that puts correlation-id into
;; saved state--perhaps into logstash.
(use '[timbre.middleware.correlation-id :as t-id])

(t-id/merge-correlation-id-middleware!)
;; or
(t-id/with-correlation-id-middleware
  ... your body here )
